#  Read Me: CodeSampleWeather

The project was created as a code challenge/sample which required allowing a user to search for weather by a city name, which is then used to query the openweather api and display the resulting weather data in a view. It was coded in about 8-9 hours, with probably 2 focused on error handling because I haven't used that method to bubble errors up to UI before and wanted to play with that.

TODOs  throughout the code note what I would change with regard to error handling and everything else.

Project requirement:
1. Carthage should be installed at `/usr/local/bin/carthage`
2. If you need to rebuild the Alamofire framework on your machine, cd into the project directory and run
`carthage update --platform iOS --no-use-binaries`
